      <h2>Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
      <p>
        As a full stack web developer, I am deeply passionate about learning and
        creating. My journey in software engineering began in 2013 while I was
        studying to become a licensed Paramedic. The subpar software we used to
        document our skills in the classroom and the field sparked a thought in
        me, "I can build something better than this." This led me to start
        learning to code, beginning with PHP and MySQL, and creating a basic web
        application to track my progress in paramedic school.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing paramedic school, I attended a coding bootcamp at UNC
        Chapel Hill. It was there that I was introduced to React JS, a
        technology that has since become a cornerstone of my development work.
        During the bootcamp, I met a like-minded engineer, and together we
        cofounded a company aimed at replacing the inefficient software I had
        experienced as a paramedic student. We successfully developed a fully
        functional application that was adopted by my alma mater and another
        school.
      </p>
      <p>
        This entrepreneurial experience solidified my interest in software
        development, prompting me to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer
        science. Simultaneously, I worked on several projects, including an
        e-commerce website and a cardiology learning platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        I completed my bachelor's degree in 2019 and subsequently began working
        with RENCI, an organization focused on providing solutions for
        researchers. Here, I was often engaged in projects involving
        asynchronous tools and services. My contributions included creating and
        enhancing workflows, a role that allowed me to collaborate with numerous
        talented engineers and researchers. At RENCI, my primary focus was on
        frontend development using React and TypeScript, complemented by backend
        tasks with Python/Django and Node.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2021, I have been with flyExclusive, a private jet charter
        company. In this role, I am involved in various projects, such as
        developing a customer-facing website, a mobile app, and multiple
        internal tools to improve business efficiency. My contributions have
        been crucial in transitioning the company to a robust software
        ecosystem, significantly aiding in its growth. My work primarily
        revolves around mobile applications using React Native and Node.js in
        TypeScript, and I have honed my skills in SQL while managing our
        PostgreSQL database. An interesting aspect of my role involves creating
        microservices in AWS to interface with Airtable, a tool used by our
        internal stakeholders for data storage, thus providing a more robust API
        for our frontend applications. Working at flyExclusive has provided me
        with a unique experience of managing legacy code and innovating new
        features from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my personal time, I enjoy volunteering with Second Chance Animal
        Rescue in Raleigh. My involvement includes assisting with adoption event
        setups and fostering multiple dogs, helping them find loving homes.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion for software is similar to a scene from one of my favorite
        Harry Potter movies, where Professor Slughorn describes a magical moment
        created by Harry's mother. The transformation of a flower petal into a
        fish in a bowl of water, described as "beautiful magic, wondrous to
        behold," resonates with my love for creating software. When I see a
        stakeholder using software I have developed to solve their problem it
        sparks joy for me. I am excited to continue my journey in software
        engineering and am eager to see what the future holds.
